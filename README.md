# Calorie Tracker App

This app was developed as a final project for my Android App Dev class. It is a Calorie Tracking App which allows users to search through the OpenFoodFact's Database and add items to their daily log, which will automatically get the calories from the database and track it according to the user's defined calorie limit they can set. Sign-in and sign-up as well as data storage is done through Google Firestore Database and Firebase's Authentication.
